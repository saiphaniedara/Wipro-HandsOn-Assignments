1. Write a Java program to create an ArrayList, add all the months of a year and print the same.
	
2. Create an application for employee management with the following classes:

a) Create an Employee class with following attributes and behaviors :
i) int empId
ii)String empName
iii)String email
iv)String gender 
v)float salary
vi) void GetEmployeeDetails() -> prints employee details

b) Create one more class EmployeeDB with the following attributes and behaviors.
(i)ArrayList list;

iii) boolean deleteEmployee(int empId)  ->delete the employee object from the collection with the given empid
iv) String showPaySlip(int empId)  -> returns the payslip of the employee with the given empId

Provide implementation for all the methods and test your program.
	
3. Create an ArrayList that can store only Strings. 
Create a printAll method that will print all the elements of the ArrayList using an Iterator.
	
4. Create an ArrayList that can store only numbers like int,float,double,etc, but not any other data type.
	
5. Implement the assignment 1 using Linked List
	
6. Implement the assignment 1 using Vector
	
7. Write a program that will have a Vector which is capable of storing Employee objects. Use an Iterator and enumeration to list all the elements of the Vector.
