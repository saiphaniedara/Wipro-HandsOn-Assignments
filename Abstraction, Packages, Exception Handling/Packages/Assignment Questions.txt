1. Create a package called test package.
Define a class called foundation inside the test package.
Inside the class, you need to define 4 integer variables:
var1 with private access modifier
var2 with default access modifier
var3 with protected access modifier
var4 with public access modifier

Import this class and packages in another class. 
Try to access all 4 variables of the foundation class and see what variables are accessible and what are not accessible.
	
2. Create a class called compartment which represents the ship compartments with attributes like height, width and breadth. 

Take care it should not conflict with the compartment class you have created in Abstract class exercise 2.

To avoid conflict create this class in a new package called com.wipro.automobile.ship 
	
3. Create a package called com.automobile. Define an abstract class called Vehicle. 
Vehicle class has the following abstract methods: 
public String getModelName() 
public String getRegistrationNumber() 
public String getOwnerName() 

Create twowheeler subpackage under automobile package
Hero  class extends  automobile.vehicle class with the following methods
public int getSpeed() 
– returns the current speed of the vehicle.
public void radio() 
– provides facility to control the radio device 

Honda class extends com.automobile.vehicle class with the following methods
public int getSpeed()
– Returns the current speed of the vehicle.
public void cdplayer() 
– provides facility to control the cd player device which is available in the car.

Create a test class to test the methods available in all these child class.
	
4. Add the following ideas to the previous hands on: 
Create FourWheeler subpackage under automobile package
Logan class extends com.automobile.Vehicle class
public int speed()
– Returns the current speed of the vehicle.
public int gps() 
– provides facility to control the gps device 

Ford class extends  com.automobile.Vehicle class
public int speed()
– Returns the current speed of the vehicle.
public int tempControl() 
– provides facility to control the air conditioning device which is available in the car
Create objects of the relevant classes and test the various functionalities of the class.
